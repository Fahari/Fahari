#### Hi there ðŸ˜€
I am Kevin K, an enthusiast in everything code. A fullstack web developer with a tad-tiny bias in front-end development.
A mantra currently holding; "If it works, it must look good!"

I love working with web frameworks and developing simple tools in my spare time. My go to starterkit being Sveltekit and Tailwind css.

Being a curious guy, I find myself lost in experimenting with different programming languages and disciplines. Python, bash and linux often being the environment of choice. 

All in all , working with virtual Doms has made me appreciate the beauty of a simple working compiler. If you know you know!

When not cursing out some hidden bugs, I will be busy looking for flags in CTF spaces.
